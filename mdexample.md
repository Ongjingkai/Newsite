# Markdown example page

This page is here to proved that I have tried out markdown files.  

Markdown can be used for really simple pages such as this but does not really  
give you the freedom to customize your page, as such mark down pages can really only be used for  
1. documents,  
1. notes,   
1. books,   
4. presentations

## Images can be placed down too!

There is a lot more functions available and you could use websites such as [Markdown Live Preview](https://markdownlivepreview.com/).  

but overall needing to learn a new language just for a simple website is going to be a huge pain and I would rather go back to using HTML.  
still here are some reasons why using markdown is good: [Markdown guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/)  
You can see my reasons back at the main page.
